/decision made in the third level.

On each Level, there will be a cutscene telling the story of the game. When the level starts, enemies will spawn and start shooting "fireballs"
at the player.The player have to dodge the bullets to avoid losing hp. Each bullet reduces the player's hp by 1 hp if the player is hit by one of them.
If the Player's hp reaches 0 , the player will die and have to replay the stage to unlock the next Level.To kill a enemy, a player has to hit the enemies with bullets.
After the enemy is hit a ____ times , the enemy will die.Enemies can shoot through walls while a player cannot do so. 
Players have a total of 100 ammo per level which will be resetted upon moving on to the next level. Once the player runs out of ammunition,
 the player have to find a fire hydrant and stand on top of it to refill their ammunition.Once all the enemies are defeated,
